            As we step into 2025, JavaScript continues to dominate the tech world.
            Year after year, it remains one of the most popular and desirable programming
            languages among developers.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Millions of developers worldwide rely on it to build everything from websites
            to mobile apps and desktop applications. This ongoing popularity shows the
            true scale and impact of JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            Iâ€™m one of those developers. JavaScript is the first (and only) language Iâ€™ve
            truly learned and used daily. Over the last four years, Iâ€™ve developed projects
            using it â€” and I genuinely enjoy working with this language.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            So, what makes JavaScript so powerful? Letâ€™s take a closer look at its advantages
            and disadvantages.
          </p>

            ðŸ”¼ Advantages of JavaScript
          </h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Compatible with All Browsers:</strong> JavaScript is supported by
              all modern web browsers, which means your code will run almost anywhere
              without extra setup.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Strong Community & Industry Support:</strong> JavaScript is backed by
              major tech companies such as Meta (React.js) and Google (Angular). Many
              startups and enterprises use JavaScript tools daily, providing a rich ecosystem.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ubiquity on the Web:</strong> JavaScript powers everything from
              interactive web pages to full-stack applications (thanks to Node.js). Itâ€™s
              nearly impossible to browse the web without encountering JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Open Source:</strong> JavaScript is maintained by a global community,
              making it dynamic and constantly evolving.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rich Interfaces:</strong> Enables developers to build interactive
              user interfaces such as carousels, dropdowns, real-time updates, and more.

          </h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Error Handling Can Break User Experience:</strong> When an error
              occurs, JavaScript can cause an entire webpage or feature to stop working if
              not properly managed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security Concerns (Client-Side Execution):</strong> Since JavaScript
              runs on the client side, it can be vulnerable to exploitation by malicious users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Browser Compatibility Issues:</strong> Different browsers may interpret
              JavaScript differently, so developers often need to write additional code or
              use polyfills to ensure consistency.

            âœ… Is JavaScript Still Worth Learning in 2025?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely. As someone who's used JavaScript for over four years building
            real-world projects, I can confidently say it remains an excellent choice.
            It powers most of the web and is used for mobile (React Native), desktop
            (Electron), and backend development (Node.js).
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            JavaScript is relatively easy to learn, versatile, and well-supported â€”
            making it ideal for both beginners and experienced developers.

            ðŸ’¬ My Perspective as a JavaScript Developer
          </h4>
          <p>
            As a developer who has spent years using JavaScript, I want to do everything
            I can to keep it at the top. Maybe itâ€™s partly my ego â€” Iâ€™ve invested a lot
            of time and energy into this language â€” but I genuinely believe in its power.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Even with the rise of AI, I see JavaScript not just surviving but evolving.
            I plan to explore how JavaScript can work with AI â€” from integrating machine
            learning APIs to building smart, interactive apps using tools like
            TensorFlow.js.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            JavaScript is more than just code to me â€” itâ€™s how I bring ideas to life.
            As AI becomes part of every app, Iâ€™ll continue using JavaScript to build
            faster, smarter, and better. The journey isnâ€™t over â€” itâ€™s just getting more exciting.
